# Introduction

This repository is a fork of the original [react-chatbot-kit](https://github.com/FredrikOseberg/react-chatbot-kit).

I decided to create a fork and improve upon it as necessary to keep some projects of mine alive, since the original repository is seemingly not maintained any more with lots of issues piling up and even PRs not being merged.
My specific use case was that I needed a multi-line input field.

This is not an actively maintained repository, but as necessary to support my project, I will make changes and irregularly.

If you have any interest in improving this fork, feel free to suggest a PR, but since I am not actively maintaining this project, it may take some time for me to respond.
