# react-chatbot-kit (fork)

This is a maintained fork of the original react-chatbot-kit. It includes small improvements and fixes (for example: multi-line input support) to keep downstream projects working.

Contributions are welcome — PRs are appreciated. I review when possible.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node 18+
- Yarn 1.22+

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

2. Run the full verification (formatting + tests):

```bash
yarn verify
```

3. Run tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

### VS Code

- Recommended: install common extensions (Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript).

## Contributing

- Keep test coverage at current levels.
- Open an issue describing the problem before or alongside a PR.
